# Matrix-Operations-in-Assembly
Computer Architecture and Assembly Language course - Final project

This is a project that implements matrix operations and solves a system of linear equations using assembly language. The operations and steps involved are typical of solving a linear regression problem using the Normal Equation method. This repository demonstrates efficient assembly language programming for computational tasks.

## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of matrix operations using assembly language. It covers different parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of matrix computations, including multiplication, inversion, and applying these operations in a practical context to solve linear regression problems.

Formula solved: w = (A^T . A)^-1 . A^T . b
